# Nameing variables (Naming rules, Tokens and reserved Keywords)
# Variables can be named using letters, numbers, and underscores, but cannot start with a number.
# Examples of valid variable names:
valid_name = "Valid"
_valid_name = "Also valid"
validName123 = "Valid too"
#Variables cannot be named using reserved keywords in Python.
# Examples of invalid variable names:
# 1validName = "Invalid"  # Cannot start with a number
# class = "Invalid"  # 'class' is a reserved keyword

#Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning 'Variable' and 'variable' are different.
# Example of case sensitivity:
Variable = "Uppercase"
variable = "Lowercase"
print(Variable, variable)
